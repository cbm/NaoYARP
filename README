BUILD (for remote execution)

- Create a folder named build 

- Enter folder build

- Execute: cmake -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<your-path-to-naoqi-sdk>/toolchain-pc.cmake ..

- Execute: ccmake .

- Set the path to YARP building directory

- Set the NaoQi version appropriately 

- Check the value of NAOYARP_IS_REMOTE

  NAOYARP_IS_REMOTE can be OFF (a library is produced) or ON (an executable is produced)

- Press c to configure again, then g to generate and exit. 

- Execute: make -jk install, where k is the number of cores in your system.




CROSSBUILD (for on-board execution)

- Create a folder named crossbuild 

- Enter folder crossbuild

- Execute: cmake -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<path-to-naoqi-ctc>/toolchain-geode.cmake ..

- Execute: ccmake .

- Set the path to YARP building directory

- Set the NaoQi version appropriately 

- Press c to configure

- Check the values of KROBOT_IS_REMOTE, NaoQiVersion, RobotPlatform 

  KROBOT_IS_REMOTE can be OFF (a library is produced) or ON (an executable is produced)

- Real-time execution for the nao requires the code to be compiled as a shared object at the moment.

- Press c to configure again, then g to generate and exit. 

- Execute: make -jk install, where k is the number of cores in your system. 




Run the created module (it should be under <your-path-to-naoqi-sdk> /bin or /lib on the latest NaoQi versions).
Network devices are created automatically!


That's all! Enjoy!
